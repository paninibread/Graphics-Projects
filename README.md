# Graphics-Projects

A series of computer graphics projects that offer a comprehensive exploration of fundamental and advanced concepts in computer graphics, implemented using OpenGL.

## Description

This repository contains a series of projects focusing on various aspects of computer graphics, implemented using OpenGL. Each project explores different concepts and techniques to create interactive and visually engaging graphical applications.

**Project 1: Picking and Moving in 2D and 3D**
- Implement picking and moving functionality using a mouse in both 2D and 3D environments.
- Explore B-Spline curves, Bezier curves, and Catmull-Rom curves for smooth and customizable curve generation.

**Project 2: Affine Transformations, Lighting, and Camera Rig**
- Utilize affine transformations to position objects accurately in 3D space, enabling translation and rotation operations.
- Implement lighting techniques to simulate illumination effects in the scene.
- Develop a camera rig system to control the viewpoint and perspective of the scene.
- Create and control a robot arm with 5 joints using keyboard input, demonstrating the application of transformations and hierarchical modeling.

**Project 3: Subdivision Surfaces and Wireframe Rendering with Texturing**
- Explore subdivision surfaces to generate smooth and detailed surfaces from coarse initial meshes.
- Implement wireframe rendering to visualize the geometry of a wireframe model, enhanced with texture mapping to apply textures to the wireframe.
- Generate a wireframe representation of a face, texture it, and render it in the scene, showcasing the combination of subdivision surfaces, wireframe rendering, and texturing.
